This (false positive on UDP open ports) may happen when the firewall is configured to reject UDP packets for most (but not all) ports with an ICMP Port Unreachable packet. This may also happen when the firewall is configured to allow UDP packets for most (but not all) ports through and filter/block/drop UDP packets for only a few ports. Both cases are uncommon.]]></DIAGNOSIS>

        <DIAGNOSIS><![CDATA[Possible scan interference detected.<P>
A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems. <BR>
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
<P>
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
<P>
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
 <P>
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
<P>
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
<P>

        <DIAGNOSIS><![CDATA[Version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol supports URL-Request Pipelining. This means that instead of using the &quot;Keep-Alive&quot; method to keep the TCP connection alive over multiple requests, the protocol allows multiple HTTP URL requests to be made in the same TCP packet. Any Web server which is HTTP 1.1 compliant should then process all the URLs requested in the single TCP packet and respond as usual.

        <DIAGNOSIS><![CDATA[Possible scan interference detected.<P>
A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems. <BR>
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
<P>
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
<P>
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
 <P>
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
<P>
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
<P>
For more details on scan interference during a PCI scan please refer to <B>ASV Scan Interference</B> section of <A HREF="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v3.1.pdf?agreement=true&time=1611566661151" TARGET="_blank">PCI DSS Approved Scanning Vendors Program Guide Version 3.1 July 2018 </A>.

For more details about this QID, please review the following Qualys KB article:<BR>

        <CONSEQUENCE><![CDATA[If the scanner cannot detect vulnerabilities on Internet-facing systems because the scan is blocked by an IDS/IPS, those vulnerabilities will remain uncorrected and may be exploited if the IDS/IPS changes or fails.]]></CONSEQUENCE>

        <DIAGNOSIS><![CDATA[Possible scan interference detected.<P>
A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems. <BR>
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
<P>
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
<P>
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
 <P>
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
<P>
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
<P>
For more details on scan interference during a PCI scan please refer to <B>ASV Scan Interference</B> section of <A HREF="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ASV_Program_Guide_v3.1.pdf?agreement=true&time=1611566661151" TARGET="_blank">PCI DSS Approved Scanning Vendors Program Guide Version 3.1 July 2018 </A>.

For more details about this QID, please review the following Qualys KB article:<BR>

The Host Scan Time does not have a direct correlation to the Duration time as displayed in the Report Summary section of a scan results report. The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

        <DIAGNOSIS><![CDATA[Possible scan interference detected.<P>
A PCI scan must be allowed to perform scanning without interference from intrusion detection systems or intrusion prevention systems. <BR>
The PCI ASV is required to post fail if scan interference is detected. 
<P>
The goal of this QID is to ensure that Active Protection Systems are not blocking, filtering, dropping or modifying network packets from a PCI Certified Scan, as such behavior could affect an ASV's ability to detect vulnerabilities. Active Protection Systems could include any of the following; IPS, WAF, Firewall, NGF, QoS Device, Spam Filter, etc. which are dynamically modifying their behavior based on info gathered from traffic patterns. This QID is triggered if a well known and popular service is not identified correctly due to possible scan interference. Services like FTP, SSH, Telnet, DNS, HTTP and Database services like MSSQL, Oracle, MySql are included.
<P>
-If an Active Protection System is found to be preventing the scan from completing, Merchants should make the required changes (e.g. whitelist) so that the ASV scan can complete unimpeded.
 <P>
-If the scan was not actively blocked, Merchants can submit a PCI False Positive/Exception Request with a statement asserting that No Active Protection System is present or blocking the scan.
<P>
Additionally, if there is no risk to the Cardholder Data Environment, such as no web service running, this can also be submitted as a PCI False Positive/Exception Request and reviewed per the standard PCI Workflow.
<P>
